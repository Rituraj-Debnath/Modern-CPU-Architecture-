CPU has major 4 components , lets learn them first and will continue with the flow:

1. Control Unit : It fetches instructions from memory , decodes them and decides which component should work. So it doesn't do calculations or store data. so Control Unit is the Commander. Ex: When a program is running, instructions live in memory. The Control Unit takes them one by one, understands what they mean, and tells the rest of the CPU what to do.

For example, when your program says:  “Add these two numbers” , the Control Unit figures out:
Which numbers?
Where are they stored?
Which unit should do the calculation?
Where should the result go?

Then it then sends signals to the registers, the ALU, and the memory system to make this happen. Without the Control Unit, the CPU would be powerful but completely directionless.

2. ALU(Arithmetic & Logic Unit): Its a physical unit made upon the silicon waffer from logic gates using transistors that performs the basic Arithmetic               addition,substraction,multiplication,division ) , Logical operations ( AND,OR,NOT,NAND,XOR,ADDER etc ) & comparisons ( > , < , >= , <= , == ). So it actually performs calculations.
ex: age = 20
if (age>18): print("vote now") else: print("No vote") , so here CU
